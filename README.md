# Neural Copilot — Code generation for VSCode

Neural Copilot provides autocomplete-style code suggestions generated by AI pair programmers as you write code. These suggestions can be triggered by natural language comments to articulate the desired code functionality.

## 1. How to use

To trigger inline completion, you'll need to type `//find {your keyword}.` (start with `//find`, end with a dot `.`)

For example

```js
//find binary search in javascript.
```

Make sure `Inline Suggest` is `enabled` from the VS Code Settings

_Note: Use `Alt+]` and `Alt+[` to move through suggestions_

## 2. Installation for Development

**Check out the installation video: https://youtu.be/MD-kzsF0Scg**

To install and starting Captain Stack:

1. Clone this repository to your PC using `git clone https://github.com/hieunc229/copilot-clone.git .`. Please note there is a dot at the end of the command
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies

3. Now, you can start the extension. From the top menu, choose `Run > Start Debugging`.

This will:

- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code and watch for changes
- Open a new VSCode window (you should use the extension there)

_Note: When you make changes, you should refresh that window to apply changes. To refresh, open Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on MacOS, or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows), then choose "Developer: Reload window"_
