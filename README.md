nvm use 18.17.1
node -v
```

2. Clone this repository to your PC using `git clone https://github.com/WenjiaoYue/copilot`.

4. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies.

5. Now, you can start the extension. From the top menu, choose `Run > Start Debugging`.

## 4. How to use

### Switch mode
Neural Copilot supports both high quality mode (default mode) and fast mode, and allows you to switch between them with one click according to your needsÔºö
- High quality mode: Using remote server's service
- Fast mode: Using local client's service

To switch between the two modes, you can click on the icon in the upper right corner:

You can modify the service url used by the two modes in package.json:

### Code suggestion
To trigger inline completion, you'll need to type `// {your keyword}` (start with your programming language's comment keyword, like `//` in C++ and `#` in python). Make sure `Inline Suggest` is `enabled` from the VS Code Settings.

For example:
